# SQL-AirTrafficControlSystem
SQL project with many queries on the created database (air traffic control system)
##The project aims to manage the database of an air traffic control system, taking into consideration significant aspects related to the complete operation of such an enterprise. To get a preliminary idea of the database, we observe the class diagram:

##
We have separated the main structure of the database into two distinct and well-differentiated parts in everyday life, namely Military and Civil air traffic control. The management system recognizes the differences between the two and provides necessary information in both cases to be able to observe the records in detail. The information includes monitoring flights (routes), details about all civilian personnel of airline companies, information about military personnel on missions, as well as passengers in civilian flights and the airplanes they travel in to a specific location. Additionally, we have added tables that record reports and flight-related information about external weather conditions, flight conditions, current location, date and time, fuel consumption, and the percentage of distance covered until that moment.
